# Getting Started with the Product

<<<<<<< HEAD
Our basic idea is to search for the kind of environment (visual and auditory) that helps reduce depressive/anxious mood aggravations.

Background research for the same is our first priority before we develop any virtual environment. We have moved the detaild research to the end, in order to keep the basics of our approach consice.
1. Research on auditory influence in modulating the mood of a person
2. Research on the effectiveness of MIPs (Mood Induction Procedures) in inducing specific targeted moods into a person, and the extent to which the person feels presence of that environment all around them.

# How we plan to approach the problem

Based on our preliminary research, we have come across a couple of different techniques:

1. Music therapy: the umbrella of techniques in which different frequencies are administered in an attempt to reduce negative emotions.
2. Mood Induction Procedures: the techniques developed (ever since the work of Schachter and Singer where they talk about how physiological emotions elicited are tried to be connected to stimuli cues) that allow induction of specific positive (or even negative) emotions in the subject. 

# Literature on the effect of different frequencies on the mood of the subject. We have usually targeted articles on moods relating to anxiety, negative thoughts, and similar depressive moods.

1. A pilot study comparing reduction of anxiety by binaural beat audio and patient-selected music in the pre-operative period. (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2044.2006.04944_12.x): Inducing brain-wave states with binaural auditory beats has been used to decrease anxiety and behavioral problems, and improve mood

2. Auditory Beats in the brain. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4727697): Binaural beats have been used to entrain the brain toward a desired frequency.

3. A comprehensive review of the psychological effects of brainwave entrainment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18780583): Recent review suggesting that alpha stimulation was preferable for relaxation, short-term stress, and pain relief, but the effectiveness of binaural beats for mood need further research.

4. A prospective, randomised, controlled study examining binaural beat audio and pre-operative anxiety in patients undergoing general anaesthesia for day case surgery. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16115248): In an interesting study, Padmanabhan and colleagues applied binaural-beat stimulation to patients suffering from pre-operative anxiety

5. Binaural beat technology in humans: a pilot study to assess psychologic and physiologic effects. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17309374): In this study, it was reported that patients who received binaural-beat stimulation in the delta frequency for 30 min daily over 60 days showed a significant decrease in trait anxiety scores assessed with the STA-I. There was a decrease in trait anxiety (p = 0.004), an increase in quality of life (p = 0.03), and a decrease in insulin-like growth factor-1 (p = 0.01) and dopamine (p = 0.02) observed between pre- and post-intervention measurements. Binaural beat technology may exhibit positive effect on self-reported psychologic measures, especially anxiety. Further research is warranted to explore the effects on anxiety using a larger, randomized and controlled trial.


6. An empirical investigation into the effect of beta- frequency binaural-beat audio signals on four measures of human memory (https://hemi-sync.com/research-papers/an-empirical-investigation-into-the-effect-of-beta-frequency-binaural-beat-audio-signals-on-four-measures-of-human-memory/): Preliminary experimental studies suggest that binaural auditory beats in the EEG beta frequency range can enhance attention and memory task performance.

7. Binaural beats: Brain wave induction and the use of binaural beats to induce brain wave patterns (https://www.pulsus.com/scholarly-articles/binaural-beats-brain-wave-induction-and-the-use-of-binaural-beatsto-induce-brain-wave-patterns-4698.html): Thus, binaural pulse is a feature that allows modifying the performance and the state of mind of an individual.

8. Application that handles brain waves by means of binaural frequencies. (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327265120_Binaural_beats_Brain_wave_induction_and_the_use_of_binaural_beats_to_induce_brain_wave_patterns): Binaural sounds can be used to change the frequency of the predominant brain waves, inducing the generation of waves capable of producing relaxation, sleep, altered states of consciousness, lucid dreams, creativity, analgesia

9. System for monitoring brain waves in studies of binaural pulses with theta rhythm on cognitive and emotional processes. (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327265120_Binaural_beats_Brain_wave_induction_and_the_use_of_binaural_beats_to_induce_brain_wave_patterns): By subjecting the brain to certain waves, cognitive processes can be improved, it takes a while before the prevailing frequency (the frequency at which the brain is working) changes, generating the frequency of the stimulus (frequency of the binaural pulse)

10. Cumulative effects of theta binaural beats on brain power and functional connectivity (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1746809418300296): Key results:- Binaural beats are capable of entraining the brain. 7 Hz binaural beats increase relative power of theta band in parietal and temporal lobes. Lengthening the duration of stimuli will result in more effective entrainment.

11. Binaural Auditory Beats affect vigilance performance and mood (https://www.monroeinstitute.org/article/2664): The results of this study provide evidence that presentation of simple binaural auditory beat stimuli during a 30-min vigilance task can affect both the task performance and the changes in mood associated with the task. The observed effects were consistent with our predictions regarding differential effects on alertness and mood. Binaural beats in the beta EEG frequency range were associated with relative improvements in target detection and reduction in the number of false alarms compared to binaural beats in the theta/delta EEG frequency range. Moreover, beta binaural beats were associated with smaller increases in task-related confusion and fatigue compared to theta/delta beats, and the two conditions had different effects on scores for depression/dejection.
Together the scales suggested in the study suggest that the negative changes in mood produced by a monotonous task may have been partially ameliorated by the presentation of beta-frequency binaural beats.

12. This is your brain on binaural beats (https://www.healthline.com/health-news/your-brain-on-binaural-beats#1): For instance, a Montreal study of 15 “mildly anxious” volunteers found a significant reduction in their anxiety when they listened to binaural beats at least 5 times each week for a month. And when researchers in Richmond, Virginia, requested 36 adults with chronic pain to listen to two recordings of binaural beats for 20 minutes each day for 2 weeks, 77 percent felt their pain lessened.

13. The Impact of Monaural Beat Stimulation on Anxiety and Cognition (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5430051/): The study reports that monaural beat stimulation at gamma (40 Hz), theta (6 Hz) and alpha (10 Hz) frequencies was effective in reducing state-anxiety scores (as assessed using the STAI-S).

14. Original sound compositions reduce anxiety in emergency department patients: a randomised controlled trial. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22171868): Of 291 patients assessed for eligibility, 170 patients completed the pre-intervention anxiety self-assessment and 169 completed the post-intervention assessment. Significant decreases (all P < 0.001) in anxiety level were observed among patients exposed to the electroacoustic musical composition (pre-intervention mean, 39; post-intervention mean, 34), audio field recordings (42; 35) or audio field recordings with embedded binaural beats (43; 37) when compared with those allocated to receive simulated ED ambient noise (40; 41) or headphones only (44; 44).

15. A prospective, randomised, controlled study examining binaural beat audio and pre-operative anxiety in patients undergoing general anaesthesia for day case surgery. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16115248): Binaural beat audio has the potential to decrease acute pre-operative anxiety significantly. (Abstract)

16. Impact of auditory stimulation at a frequency of 5 Hz in verbal memory. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18985458):Auditory stimulation over a long time at a frequency of 5 Hz generates a coupling of brain activity that increases the capacity of immediate verbal memory.

17. Pilot feasibility study of binaural auditory beats for reducing symptoms of inattention in children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20117669): The results from this study indicate that binaural auditory beat stimulation did not significantly reduce the symptom of inattention in the experimental group. However, parents and adolescents stated that homework problems due to inattention improved during the 3-week study. Parents and participants stated that the modality was easy to use and helpful. Therefore, this modality should be studied over a longer time frame in a larger sample to further its effectiveness to reduce the symptom of inattention in those diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
