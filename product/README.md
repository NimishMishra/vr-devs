Background research

1. A pilot study comparing reduction of anxiety by binaural beat audio and patient-selected music in the pre-operative period. (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2044.2006.04944_12.x)

    Inducing brain-wave states with binaural auditory beats has been used to decrease anxiety and behavioral problems, and improve mood

2. Auditory Beats in the brain. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4727697)
    Binaural beats have been used to entrain the brain toward a desired frequency.

3. A comprehensive review of the psychological effects of brainwave entrainment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18780583)
    Recent review suggesting that alpha stimulation was preferable for relaxation, short-term stress, and pain relief, but the effectiveness of binaural beats for mood need further research.

4. A prospective, randomised, controlled study examining binaural beat audio and pre-operative anxiety in patients undergoing general anaesthesia for day case surgery. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16115248)

    In an interesting study, Padmanabhan and colleagues applied binaural-beat stimulation to patients suffering from pre-operative anxiety

5. Binaural beat technology in humans: a pilot study to assess psychologic and physiologic effects. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17309374)

    In this study, it was reported that patients who received binaural-beat stimulation in the delta frequency for 30 min daily over 60 days showed a significant decrease in trait anxiety scores assessed with the STA-I.
