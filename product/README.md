# Getting Started with the Product

Basic idea is to search for the kind of environment (visual and auditory) that helps reduce depressive/anxious mood aggravations.
Background research for the same is our first priority before we develop any virtual environement:

1. A pilot study comparing reduction of anxiety by binaural beat audio and patient-selected music in the pre-operative period. (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2044.2006.04944_12.x): Inducing brain-wave states with binaural auditory beats has been used to decrease anxiety and behavioral problems, and improve mood

2. Auditory Beats in the brain. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4727697): Binaural beats have been used to entrain the brain toward a desired frequency.

3. A comprehensive review of the psychological effects of brainwave entrainment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18780583): Recent review suggesting that alpha stimulation was preferable for relaxation, short-term stress, and pain relief, but the effectiveness of binaural beats for mood need further research.

4. A prospective, randomised, controlled study examining binaural beat audio and pre-operative anxiety in patients undergoing general anaesthesia for day case surgery. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16115248): In an interesting study, Padmanabhan and colleagues applied binaural-beat stimulation to patients suffering from pre-operative anxiety

5. Binaural beat technology in humans: a pilot study to assess psychologic and physiologic effects. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17309374): In this study, it was reported that patients who received binaural-beat stimulation in the delta frequency for 30 min daily over 60 days showed a significant decrease in trait anxiety scores assessed with the STA-I. There was a decrease in trait anxiety (p = 0.004), an increase in quality of life (p = 0.03), and a decrease in insulin-like growth factor-1 (p = 0.01) and dopamine (p = 0.02) observed between pre- and post-intervention measurements. Binaural beat technology may exhibit positive effect on self-reported psychologic measures, especially anxiety. Further research is warranted to explore the effects on anxiety using a larger, randomized and controlled trial.


6. An empirical investigation into the effect of beta- frequency binaural-beat audio signals on four measures of human memory (https://hemi-sync.com/research-papers/an-empirical-investigation-into-the-effect-of-beta-frequency-binaural-beat-audio-signals-on-four-measures-of-human-memory/): Preliminary experimental studies suggest that binaural auditory beats in the EEG beta frequency range can enhance attention and memory task performance.

7. Binaural beats: Brain wave induction and the use of binaural beats to induce brain wave patterns (https://www.pulsus.com/scholarly-articles/binaural-beats-brain-wave-induction-and-the-use-of-binaural-beatsto-induce-brain-wave-patterns-4698.html): Thus, binaural pulse is a feature that allows modifying the performance and the state of mind of an individual.

8. Application that handles brain waves by means of binaural frequencies. (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327265120_Binaural_beats_Brain_wave_induction_and_the_use_of_binaural_beats_to_induce_brain_wave_patterns): Binaural sounds can be used to change the frequency of the predominant brain waves, inducing the generation of waves capable of producing relaxation, sleep, altered states of consciousness, lucid dreams, creativity, analgesia

9. System for monitoring brain waves in studies of binaural pulses with theta rhythm on cognitive and emotional processes. (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327265120_Binaural_beats_Brain_wave_induction_and_the_use_of_binaural_beats_to_induce_brain_wave_patterns): By subjecting the brain to certain waves, cognitive processes can be improved, it takes a while before the prevailing frequency (the frequency at which the brain is working) changes, generating the frequency of the stimulus (frequency of the binaural pulse)
