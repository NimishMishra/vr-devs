# Instructions to run the Unity project attached

The original project was created with Unity 2019.2.5. We recommend at least Unity 2019 for smooth experience.

There are a couple of files which were > 100 MB and were not being uploaded. So currently they are in zip format. The user will need to unzip them to use the project in Unity.

1. product\Forest Scene\Library\Occlusion\input.scene
2. product\Forest Scene\Library\PlayerDataCache\Android\Data\sharedassets0.assets
